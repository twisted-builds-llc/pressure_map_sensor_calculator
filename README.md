This is the Pressure & Map sensor scale calculator by Twisted Builds LLC.

This calculator is handy for converting pressure sensors from factory calibrations to aftermarket calibrations, or building scale maps from linear sensors that only provide you a min/max pressure and voltage.

You input the low voltage (normally 0.00V or 0.5V) and then the pressure the sensor reads at that voltage. Do the same for high voltage/pressure. Then you can input "Your Voltage" which is the voltage you want a 
pressure reading at. This will report the pressure the sensor is reading at your input'd voltage.
